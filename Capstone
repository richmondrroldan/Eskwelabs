Week 3 (05/27): Question and Data Set(s)
What is the question you hope to answer? What data are you planning to use to answer that question? 
What do you know about the data so far? Why did you choose this topic?

ON AGRICULTURE
I'm planning to predict oversupply of agricultural products.
I have a dataset from data.gov.ph regarding marketprices on a per day basis.
I know that the data is not sufficient, the columns that are provided are just enough. Data cleaning might be required on one of the fields.
I chose this topic to help farmers lessen if not eradicate profit loss.

ON EDUCATION
How much impact does the student-teacher ratio impact the quality of education here in the Philippines?
I have a dataset from data.gov.ph regarding the current student-teacher ratio, I am still looking for other datasets that can help me with this.
The datasets are incomplete, having a 3-5 year gap on datasets.
I've always been interested on how we can improve the education system here in the Philippines, is it simply by making it accessible, 
or making it easier for those who teach so that they can focus on each student.
